\par The business use case diagram is in figure
\ref{fig:business-use-case-diagram}. Note that there are no interested
stakeholders displayed in the diagram. This was done for the sake of
simplicity because displaying them would cause a lot of crossings. They are of
course included in the corresponding section in each use case.
