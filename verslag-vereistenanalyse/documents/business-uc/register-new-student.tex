	\begin{description}
		\item[3a] After having checked the information provided by the student, the
		registration committee notices that some documents are missing. This time not
		because the student has forgotten them, but because the student just doesn't
		have these documents (high school diploma, evidence of having passed a
		matriculation, \ldots).
		\begin{enumerate}
		  \item The registration committee makes the student aware that he/she can't be
		  inscribed without these documents.
		  \item The student leaves and can't be inscribed until he obtains the missing
		  documents.
		\end{enumerate}

	received all the according documents and student card.
