\par \emph{As a member of the exemption committee, I can approve and disapprove an exemption.}

\subsection{Path}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system gives the member an overview of outstanding exemption
  requests.
  \item The member selects one exemption request to settle.
  \item The system gives an overview of the selected exemption request (i.e.
  which course, which student and motivation).
  \item The member chooses to approve or disapprove the exemption.
  \item The member confirms his choice.
  \item The system sends an approval or disapproval mail to the student.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confirmation}

requests of his faculty.
