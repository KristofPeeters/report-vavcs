\subsection{Path}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system gives the student an overview of his chosen courses together
  with an option to apply for an exemption.
  \item The registered student chooses one course he wishes to obtain an
  exemption for and he selects the apply for exemption option.
  \item The system displays an exemption page where the user has to fill in the
  substitute course, the institute where he followed that course and a
  motivation with additional information why the exemption should be approved.
  \item The registered student fills in these details.

  registered student and the exemption committee with all the entered information.
